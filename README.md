# NGINX

Here be useful Nginx configs, security hardening, object or service related optimizations, etc.

## Installation

Almost in all cases, simply put it into your `/nginx/conf.d/` or `/conf-enabled/` directory.
If you need some help with this, let me know, I try to make some detailed instructions for you.

## Configs
  - pve.conf — hardened and secured Nginx configuration for your ProxmoxVE WebUI.
    > Tested on version 6.3-3

## Subconfig
Some regularly used configuration parts, usually included in my configs.
\n I recommend downloading them with the main config parts.
